//For this assignment, I chose a square that 'fears' the cursor. Every time the cursor interacts with the square, it'll go to a random spot away from the cursor. As it moves,it will shrink in size

    //since it will be too hard to find the square, I reseted the square size back to the original size when it shrinks too much
